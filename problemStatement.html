                            cities in India are struggling to cope with increasing water scarcity due to declining groundwater
                            levels, water quality continues to be a major problem posing a serious risk to health and lives.
                            Infact, a recent <a href="http://wateraidindia.in/publication/water-gap-state-worlds-water-2018/" target="_blank"> Water Aid report </a> finds that India is among the top countries with the worst
                            access to clean water close to homes.<br>

                            Unsafe water and food containing harmful microbial pathogens are the major source of illnesses
                            and mortality across the world. It is estimated that, infectious diseases cause about 40% of the
                            approximately 50 million total annual deaths worldwide. Contaminated drinking water alone
                            affects a tenth of the world’s population, with bacterial contamination estimated to cause over
                            500,000 diarrheal deaths each year. Similarly, the microbial contamination in food industry cost
                            the loss of many millions of dollars each year. Thus, detection of potentially threatening bacteria
                            in water and food is of utmost importance for preventing the spread of diseases that result in
                            unwarranted deaths and illnesses.</h5><br>

                            of these pathogens. However, current methods of bacterial detection rely upon expensive
                            laboratory based time consuming techniques which require trained manpower and take at least
                            24-48 hours. This waiting time prevents quick action and the consequence can be severe since
                            the contaminated water or food may already have been consumed by then. Thus, there is an
                            urgent need for:<br>
                            1. Easy-to-use, rapid detection test for infectious pathogens in water and food (within 1-2
                            hours)<br>
                            2. Portable solution which can be used directly at the site and be able to geotag/upload

                                FFEM’s mission is to make environmental data open and easily available to all. Improved
                                access to crucial data on environmental parameters would help improve lives and
                                Livelihoods.<br>
                                FFEM started by designing a low cost water quality test kit. The kit uses the camera and flash of
                                a smartphone as a replacement for a colorimeter to perform simple tests for inorganic
                                parameters such as Fluoride, Nitrate, Arsenic III, Iron, Chromium VI, pH, Copper, etc. Though
                                this test was designed for drinking water parameters, it finds application in lake and river water
                                monitoring as well with parameters such as Chlorophyll A and Dissolved Oxygen being added.
                                The cost of testing has come down significantly. For example, a Fluoride test which would cost
                                INR 500 in a laboratory can now be performed for INR 20. FFEM’s tests are within 10% of a laboratory test which make them an ideal screening tool.<br>
                                Similarly, in urban lake monitoring, tests that would take days to perform, can now be done by
                                interested citizens on the spot using their own smartphones.

                                <strong>● Prioritizing action on complex city-wide challenges</strong><br>
                                A majority of the big pains affecting urban areas – such as mobility, climate change etc.,
                                are a complex intermingling of several issues. CitySight unpacks these complex
                                challenges for city administrators, and helps to identify concrete action areas –
                                translating action points to lists that can easily integrate in existing govt mechanisms for
                                driving action – such as Government Orders (GOs).
                                Sample analysis question – How might we encourage more people to use public
                                transport so that there are fewer private vehicles on the road, traffic reduces, and overall
                                mobility improves?<br>
                                Analysis direction – Can we identify what parts of a given city are not within 500 mt
                                walking distance of access to public transport (via bus stop, metro station etc.) so that
                                we can improve last-mile connectivity of public transport?<br><br>
                                <strong>● Integrating the urban poor in city fabric of life</strong><br>
                                81 million urban Indians (1 in 4) live below the official poverty line. Poverty is rapidly
                                becoming urbanized, and while rural poverty is still higher than urban poverty – the gap
                                is closing. However, cities have several unique strengths in combating poverty – strong
                                local economies, ease of identifying and reaching the poor given density of population,
                                and strong potential for public-private partnerships to develop &amp; deliver pro-poor
                                services. CitySight helps in creating, managing, and evaluating pro-poor safety nets in urban areas through the lens of “spatial inclusion” that looks at accessibility of different
                                services such as housing, education, healthcare, nutrition etc.<br>
                                Sample analysis question – How might we achieve zero hunger in cities?<br>
                                Analysis direction – Can we identify if there is adequate access to government ration
                                shops/fair price shops to access subsidized food items?<br><br>
                                <strong>● Improving Govt scheme/program delivery</strong><br>
                                Urban investment by the govt of India is growing exponentially as center and states
                                realize the economic value of cities. In planning period 2014-17 the allocation to cities
                                grew by 315% and is expected to grow again in the current planning period. CitySight
                                helps in unlocking the potential of every Rupee invested – by identifying how different
                                departments and agencies can converge their efforts and create more citizen-friendly
                                outcomes.<br>
                                Sample analysis question – How might the affordable housing scheme be primed for
                                success?<br>
                                Analysis direction – Can we identify if public transport connectivity to affordable housing
                                developments can be improved?<br><br>
                                <strong>● Improving urban sustainability</strong><br>
                                Climate change is increasingly becoming a problem of cities – caused by cities (which
                                account for 75% of energy use while occupying only 3% of all land), and also most
                                visible in cities (think extreme weather events, flooding linked to sea-level rise etc.).
                                Direct and indirect impacts of climate change in Indian cities are already visible. Some of
                                these are visible over longitudinal study periods – sea level rise, water scarcity, and heat
                                waves. Others have more immediately visibility and recurring impacts – extreme weather
                                events and forced urban migration of climate refugees. CitySight combines aerial
                                imagery, sensor data, govt data, and crowd-sourced data; and analyzes them through
                                powerful open-source algorithms to identify opportunities for city administrators to take
                                specific actions to fight climate change.<br>
                                Sample analysis question – How might green cover be improved in cities?<br>
                                Analysis direction – Can we identify state of green cover at a neighbourhood/ward-level and specific action steps?<br>
