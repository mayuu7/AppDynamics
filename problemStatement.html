                            <h5>Water scarcity and water pollution are major environmental issues in India. While a number of
                            cities in India are struggling to cope with increasing water scarcity due to declining groundwater
                            levels, water quality continues to be a major problem posing a serious risk to health and lives.
                            Infact, a recent Water Aid report finds that India is among the top countries with the worst
                            access to clean water close to homes.<br>
                            As part of this theme, we want participants to build efficient and low cost solutions for providing
                            clean drinking water to unserved communities and for testing of water quality.<br>
                            We present below a couple of problem statements which are potential problem areas to be
                            solved for under this theme. Feel free to pick these as the problem areas to propose your

                            <h5>
                            Unsafe water and food containing harmful microbial pathogens are the major source of illnesses
                            and mortality across the world. It is estimated that, infectious diseases cause about 40% of the
                            approximately 50 million total annual deaths worldwide. Contaminated drinking water alone
                            affects a tenth of the worldâ€™s population, with bacterial contamination estimated to cause over
                            500,000 diarrheal deaths each year. Similarly, the microbial contamination in food industry cost
                            the loss of many millions of dollars each year. Thus, detection of potentially threatening bacteria
                            in water and food is of utmost importance for preventing the spread of diseases that result in
                            unwarranted deaths and illnesses.</h5><br><br>

                            of these pathogens. However, current methods of bacterial detection rely upon expensive
                            laboratory based time consuming techniques which require trained manpower and take at least
                            24-48 hours. This waiting time prevents quick action and the consequence can be severe since
                            the contaminated water or food may already have been consumed by then. Thus, there is an
                            urgent need for:<br>
                            1. easy-to-use, rapid detection test for infectious pathogens in water and food (within 1-2
                            hours).<br>
                            2. Portable solution which can be used directly at the site and be able to geotag/upload

                            quality of life indicators in urban India. Quality of life data can be made actionable for city
                            administrators by helping them understand WHERE to act, and within these areas,
                            understanding which areas to prioritize. Much of this data which is available today with the
                            government lacks location intelligence even though text-format addresses are available in most
                            cases. Hence, there is a need to think innovatively about how to generate location-tagged data
                            on quality of life in cities.<br>
                            As part of this theme, we want participants to build efficient solutions to collect location-tagged
